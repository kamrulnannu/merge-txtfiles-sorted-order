This is known as external merge sort.

PROJECT:
   Merge mulitple text files in sorted order by considering the fact that
   main memeory (RAM) is enough to keep large text files in the memory.
INPUT:
   There are multiple text files. Assume that these files are lexicographically
   sorted.

OUTPUT:
 - Merge all lines from input files and write them in outfile in
   lexicographically sorted order.
 - Input files may or may not have empty/blank lines, but
   OutFile should have no empty/blank lines
 - Same line(s) may exists in one or more InputFiles, but OutFile
   should not have duplicate lines. Note: if text of two or more lines
   are look same by human eye, but diff command shows difference, these lines
   will not be considered as duplicate. example: "abc is ABC" is not same
   as " abc is ABC   " - note space.
 - Exception: Line "ABC is abc" and "abc is ABC" will be considered
   duplicate because no trail or begining space.
 - It is assumed that each input file is sorted lexicographically.
   If it is not sorted, the program should complain and exit gracefully.
 - The code should handle the case when input files are very large and 
   the machine does not have enough RAM to keep data of all input files in memory.

HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
 - Please see build_instruction.txt

TEST
 - Command line: ./bin/merge_txt_files InputDir OutFile [num_line_read_per_input_file]
     (a) merge_txt_files: executable
     (b) InputDir: input files will be in this directory
     (c) OutFile: The program will merge all text files
                  and write in sorted order in this file.
                  Outfile will be created in current directory.
     (d) num_line_read_per_input_file: This is an optional command line
         argument. Default value is 5. User provided value should be greater
         than 2 or more. Due to memory concern, the program
         will read user given lines from each input file. When these lines
         in memory are written in out file, it will read next batch from
         input files and continue until processed all input files.
         Example:
           - There are 5 input files
           - user provided value = 6 for num_line_read_per_input_file
           - Asuume max length of each line 80 characters
           - So at any time, the code will allocate at most 5 * 6 * 80 = 2400
             bytes.
